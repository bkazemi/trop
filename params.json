It features options to get\r\ninformation about tr-remote torrents by seeding torrents\r\nor by a specific set of tracker URLs. This project aims to\r\nprovide information from transmission-remote to the user\r\nin a clean way, and make doing common tasks more automatic,\r\ninterchangeably through command-line or scripts. The code\r\nis written to be as POSIX compliant as possible.\r\n\r\n## Installing:\r\n\r\nThe recommended way to install trop is to use the \\`install.sh'\r\nscript. The install script will install the trop files to the\r\npath specified in the PREFIX environment variable. The default\r\npath is \\`~/.trop'.\r\n\r\nIf you prefer to install trop in a different\r\nfashion, the only requirement is that all files distributed in\r\nthe release are kept in the same directory. Any other configuration\r\nis not guaranteed to work.\r\n\r\n## The \\`tracker' file\r\n\r\nThe tracker file is used to bind an alias to a set of bittorrent tracker\r\nURLs. That way you can gather information about torrents specific to a tracker, or a\r\nset of trackers.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of an entry:\r\n```\r\nexample : primary-tracker.example.org\r\n\t+ second-tracker.example.org\r\n\t+ third-tracker.example.com\r\n```\r\nThe first word is the alias; The second word is the primary tracker. Both these entries\r\nare required. The alias and all tracker entries must NOT contain any spaces. There must\r\nbe a space on both sides of the alias-primary tracker seperator (the colon).\r\nSecondary tracker entries must contain a \\`+' symbol as the first non-whitespace character,\r\nfollowed by a space, then the tracker entry. There may not be more than one unique tracker URL entry\r\nin any alias. Any number of secondary trackers may be specified. You may interactively add trackers\r\nthrough the \\`-ta' flag in trop.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\ntrop is licensed under the BSD2 Clause.
