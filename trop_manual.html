TROP(1)                 FreeBSD General Commands Manual                TROP(1)

<span class="bold">NAME</span>
     <span class="bold">trop</span> - transmission-remote operations

<span class="bold">SYNOPSIS</span>
     <span class="bold">trop</span> [<span class="bold">-h</span> <span class="underline">HOST:PORT</span>] [<span class="bold">-a</span> <span class="underline">USER:PASS</span>] <span class="underline">options</span> <span class="underline">...</span>

<span class="bold">DESCRIPTION</span>
     <span class="bold">trop</span> is a shell script for Unix-like systems designed to make interaction
     with transmission-remote(1) easier.  It is written in pure POSIX Bourne
     shell and AWK; This allows <span class="bold">trop</span> to be used on nearly any Unix system that
     transmission can be built on.  A nice feature of <span class="bold">trop</span> is the ability to
     save the default host and authentication information in the <span class="underline">tropriv.sh</span>
     file.  That way you don't have to supply this information on the command-
     line every time you need to use tr-remote.  It also features options to
     make common tr-remote tasks much quicker to type, like the <span class="bold">-t</span> switch,
     which allows you to pass an option to a torrent without the dash before
     the flag.  This simple shorthand makes using common commands like
           transmission-remote <span class="bold">-t</span> <span class="underline">ID</span> <span class="bold">-i</span>
     much less tedious on the day-to-day.

     The other goal of <span class="bold">trop</span> is to provide statistical information about
     torrents in a clean fashion.  An example of this need is when the user
     would like to view information about the upload rates of the torrents
     currently seeding.  transmission-remote(1) indeed provides a way to get
     this with the `-t all -l' sequence, but it is more information than
     needed, and the format is unwieldy.  To combat this issue, <span class="bold">trop</span> has the
     <span class="bold">-sul</span> switch to display the name and upload rate of seeding torrents in a
     clean format.  <span class="bold">trop</span> also has the nifty feature to display torrent
     information from a set of tracker URLs.  To achieve this, you define an
     alias that binds to one or more tracker URLs in the <span class="underline">tracker</span> file
     distributed with <span class="bold">trop</span>.  See <span class="underline">README</span> for more information.

<span class="bold">OPTIONS</span>
     <span class="bold">-h</span> <span class="underline">HOST:PORT</span>
             Set the host and-or port that transmission-remote(1) will attempt
             to connect to.  You may set either the <span class="underline">HOST</span> or <span class="underline">PORT</span> options
             separately, or both with the colon format.  You may NOT separate
             them with a space.  The default may be set in the HOSTPORT
             variable in the <span class="underline">tropriv.sh</span> file.

     <span class="bold">-a</span> <span class="underline">USER:PASS</span>
             Set the user-name and password that transmission-remote(1) will
             attempt to connect with.  The default may be set in the AUTH
             variable in the <span class="underline">tropriv.sh</span> file.

     <span class="bold">-p</span> <span class="underline">options</span> <span class="underline">...</span>
             Pass flags directly to transmission-remote(1).  All successive
             flags will be interpreted as transmission-remote(1) flags.  No
             <span class="bold">trop</span> options may be supplied after this flag.

     <span class="bold">-m</span> <span class="underline">base</span> [<span class="underline">new-base</span>]
             Move all the torrents whose directories start with <span class="underline">base</span> to
             <span class="underline">new-base</span>.  The <span class="underline">base</span> is the beginning of the path of any matching
             torrents location as stored in the Transmission session's
             records.  This may be the absolute path that the torrents file(s)
             are stored in, or a relative path to the current working
             directory of where your Transmission session was invoked
             (generally $HOME).  For example, the torrent with the ID 1 may
             have it's location stored in Transmission as `dir1/dir2'.
             Because this is not an absolute path, (ie. the path doesn't start
             with `/') Transmission will internally append the CWD in which it
             was started in.  Let's say that Transmission was started in $HOME
             which expands to /home/user.  Torrent 1 will then be seen as
             being in $HOME/dir1/dir2, or /home/user/dir1/dir2.  This is good
             when you have to move your torrents to a new user's home path,
             because you don't have to change the base directory of the
             torrents.  But what if you do have torrents with a hard-coded
             $HOME, or an otherwise undesirable base path?  If you have
             hundreds of hard-coded torrents whose locations have changed from
             /home/user/ to a different user's $HOME, /home/user2, moving each
             file's location in Transmission can be tedious.  <span class="bold">-m</span> was designed
             to move torrents like these to a new base easily.  To aid with
             the example, to move all torrents whose base is stored as
             /home/user/ to /home/user2, the following command sequence would
             be used:
                   trop -m /home/user /home/user2
             Now, all torrents with the base /home/user/ have been updated to
             point to /home/user2/.  If you omit <span class="underline">new-base</span>, all matching
             torrents' <span class="underline">base</span> will be stripped from their location.  One
             important thing to note is that currently if you attempt to
             remove the base and the resulting relative path is still the same
             Transmission will _not_ update it to the relative path. However,
             once you do move the base, you can strip it to a relative path
             and not have to fuss if you move bases again.

     <span class="bold">-tm</span> <span class="underline">tracker-alias</span>
             Fuctionally equivalent to <span class="bold">-m</span> but filter out torrents not matching
             the trackers listed under <span class="underline">tracker-alias</span>

     <span class="bold">-dl</span>     Show information about downloading torrents.  This will include
             torrents that are both `uploading' and `downloading' information.

     <span class="bold">-tdl</span> <span class="underline">tracker-alias</span>
             Fuctionally equivalent to <span class="bold">-dl</span> but filter out torrents not
             matching the trackers listed under <span class="underline">tracker-alias</span>

     <span class="bold">-ns</span>     List number of torrents seeding.  This does NOT include torrents
             that are both `uploading' and `downloading' information.

     <span class="bold">-tns</span> <span class="underline">tracker-alias</span>
             Fuctionally equivalent to <span class="bold">-ns</span> but filter out torrents not
             matching the trackers listed under <span class="underline">tracker-alias</span>

     <span class="bold">-si</span>     Show information about seeding torrents.  This flag will display
             all information about each seeding torrent (equivalent to `-t id
             -i' in tr-remote).

     <span class="bold">-sul</span>    List seeding torrents and their upload rates.  This flag will
             display the `Name' and `Upload' lines in a tabular format.

     <span class="bold">-ta</span> [<span class="underline">tracker-alias</span>]
             Add a tracker alias to the <span class="underline">tracker</span> file interactively.  This
             option will ask the user to enter a tracker alias, the primary
             tracker to be associated with this alias, whether or not to add
             any secondary trackers and how many, then each secondary tracker
             on separate lines.

     <span class="bold">-tul</span> <span class="underline">tracker-alias</span>
             Functionally equivalent to the <span class="bold">-si</span> flag, but gets seeding
             torrents by tracker-alias.

     <span class="bold">-ts</span> <span class="underline">tracker-alias</span>
             List information about seeding torrents by tracker-alias. The
             information is more terse than that of <span class="bold">-si</span>, this is intentional;
             This switch was designed to filter out tracker-specific torrents
             in <span class="bold">-si</span>, and get more information about a specific torrent from
             this output.

     <span class="bold">-tt</span> <span class="underline">tracker-alias</span>
             Show the total amount downloaded from a tracker set as seen by
             the trackers (free-leech downloads are not included).

     <span class="bold">-t</span> <span class="underline">ID</span> <span class="underline">option</span>
             Pass an option to a torrent.  The option to supply is any valid
             option coupled with the tr-remote `-t' switch, however, the
             leading dashes are removed.

     <span class="bold">-td</span> <span class="underline">ID</span> <span class="underline">action</span>
             Add torrent to a queue that will perform <span class="underline">action</span> when it
             completes.  <span class="underline">action</span> is any valid option coupled with the tr-remote
             `-t' switch, however the leading dashes _must_ be removed.  This
             is the same format as the <span class="bold">-t</span> switch.  The variables
             ADD_TRACKER_DONE and ADD_TRACKER_DONE_ACT in <span class="underline">trop.conf</span> are used
             to control the behavior of this command.  See <span class="underline">README</span> for more
             information.

     <span class="bold">-notd</span>   Stop torrent from being added to the torrent-done queue if
             torrents are automatically being added with the ADD_TORRENT_DONE
             option in <span class="underline">trop.conf</span>.

     <span class="bold">-terr</span>   Show the name, ID, location and error field of torrents that show
             signs of an error.  <span class="bold">trop</span> will warn the user if it detects a
             torrent error.

     <span class="bold">-tdel</span> <span class="underline">tracker-alias</span>
             Remove <span class="underline">tracker-alias</span> from the <span class="underline">trackers</span> file.

     <span class="bold">-tl</span> [<span class="underline">tracker-alias</span>]
             Show all the tracker URLs that are binded to <span class="underline">tracker-alias</span>.  If
             no argument is supplied, <span class="bold">trop</span> will display all tracker-aliases
             and their tracker URLs.

     <span class="bold">-startup</span>
             Initialize <span class="bold">trop</span> defaults upon login. See <span class="underline">README</span> for more
             information.

     <span class="bold">-q</span>      Suppress all message output from <span class="bold">trop</span>.

     <span class="bold">-V</span> <span class="bold">-version</span>
             Show version information.  This includes the latest
             transmission-remote(1) version that <span class="bold">trop</span> was tested against.

     <span class="bold">-help</span>   Print a short description of the options on the command-line.

<span class="bold">EXAMPLES</span>
     Show details about the torrent with the ID 1:

           trop -t1 i

     Add a tracker alias named 'demonii':

           trop -ta demonii

     Show the upload rates of torrents under the 'demonii' alias:

           trop -tul demonii

     Supply the host and authorization information on the command-line:

           trop -h example.org:6789 -a bob:secretpass -sul
