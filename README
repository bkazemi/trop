| Introduction
--------------
trop is a shell script designed to make interaction with
transmission-remote easier. It started as a group of different
scripts I threw together to get specific information about
torrents that was not explicitly included as an option in
transmission-remote. My primary goal with this project is to
get information or do common tasks in tr-remote in a convenient
way.

| Installing:
-------------
The recommended way to install trop is to use the `install.sh'
script. The install script will install the trop files to the
path specified in the PREFIX environment variable. The default
path is `~/.trop'.

If you prefer to install trop in a different
fashion, the only requirement is that all files distributed in
the release are kept in the same directory. Any other configuration
is not guaranteed to work.

| Storing tr-remote authentication information
----------------------------------------------
To save a default host and/or user:pass combination, the tropriv.sh file was created.
To save the host information, open tropriv.sh and enter the default you'd like to use in
the USERHOST variable like so:

	USERHOST='example.org:1234' # set here for default

And likewise for the user:pass (-n switch in tr-remote)

	AUTH='bob:secretpass' # set here for default

| The `tracker' file
--------------------
The tracker file is used to bind an alias to a set of bittorrent tracker
URLs. That way you can gather information about torrents specific to a tracker, or a
set of trackers.

Here is an example of an entry:

example : primary-tracker.example.org
	+ second-tracker.example.org
	+ third-tracker.example.com

The first word is the alias; The second word is the primary tracker. Both these entries
are required. The alias and all tracker entries must NOT contain any spaces. There must
be a space on both sides of the alias-primary tracker separator (the colon).
Secondary tracker entries must contain a `+' symbol as the first non-whitespace character,
followed by a space, then the tracker entry. There may not be more than one unique tracker URL entry
in any alias. Any number of secondary trackers may be specified. You may interactively add trackers
through the `-ta' flag in trop.

| trop.conf - Configuration
---------------------------
trop.conf is used to set default actions upon trop initalization. This file is simply a shell script
with variables that trop sources to get defaults. Each variable is commented in trop.conf to show what
it is used for.

| Setting up trop upon login
----------------------------
In order to use certain features, trop must be called with the -startup flag once when logging in.
Where to add this depends on your login shell. For Bourne-like shells this would be \`~/.profile\';
In Zsh, it is \`~/.zprofile'. Typically you would look for your default shell in /etc/passwd.
Once you've found out your login shell, add this to the login script:

hash trop 2>&- && trop -startup
