<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <B>trop</B> is a shell script for Unix-like systems designed to make interaction
     with <B>transmission-remote(1)</B> easier.  It is written in pure POSIX Bourne
     shell and AWK; This allows <B>trop</B> to be used on nearly any Unix system that
     transmission can be built on.  A nice feature of <B>trop</B> is the ability to
     save the default host and authentication information in the <I>tropriv.sh</I>
     file.  That way you don't have to supply this information on the command-
     line every time you need to use tr-remote.  It also features options to
     make common tr-remote tasks much quicker to type, like the <B>-t</B> switch,
     which allows you to pass an option to a torrent without the dash before
     the flag.  This simple shorthand makes using common commands like
           transmission-remote <B>-t</B> <I>ID</I> <B>-i</B>
     much less tedious on the day-to-day.

     The other goal of <B>trop</B> is to provide statistical information about
     torrents in a clean fashion.  An example of this need is when the user
     would like to view information about the upload rates of the torrents
     currently seeding.  <B>transmission-remote(1)</B> indeed provides a way to get
     this with the `-t all -l' sequence, but it is more information than
     needed, and the format is unwieldy.  To combat this issue, <B>trop</B> has the
     <B>-sul</B> switch to display the name and upload rate of seeding torrents in a
     clean format.  <B>trop</B> also has the nifty feature to display torrent
     information from a set of tracker URLs.  To achieve this, you define an
     alias that binds to one or more tracker URLs in the <I>tracker</I> file
     distributed with <B>trop</B>.  See <I>README</I> for more information.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
     <B>-h</B> <I>HOST:PORT</I>
             Set the host and-or port that <B>transmission-remote(1)</B> will attempt
             to connect to.  You may set either the <I>HOST</I> or <I>PORT</I> options
             separately, or both with the colon format.  You may NOT separate
             them with a space.  The default may be set in the HOSTPORT
             variable in the <I>tropriv.sh</I> file.

     <B>-a</B> <I>USER:PASS</I>
             Set the user-name and password that <B>transmission-remote(1)</B> will
             attempt to connect with.  The default may be set in the AUTH
             variable in the <I>tropriv.sh</I> file.

     <B>-p</B> <I>options</I> <I>...</I>
             Pass flags directly to <B>transmission-remote(1)</B>.  All successive
             flags will be interpreted as <B>transmission-remote(1)</B> flags.  No
             <B>trop</B> options may be supplied after this flag.

     <B>-m</B> <I>base</I> [<I>new-base</I>]
             Move all the torrents whose directories start with <I>base</I> to
             <I>new-base</I>.  The <I>base</I> is the beginning of the path of any matching
             torrents location as stored in the Transmission session's
             records.  This may be the absolute path that the torrents file(s)
             are stored in, or a relative path to the current working
             directory of where your Transmission session was invoked
             to move torrents like these to a new base easily.  To aid with
             the example, to move all torrents whose base is stored as
             /home/user/ to /home/user2, the following command sequence would
             be used:
                   trop -m /home/user /home/user2
             Now, all torrents with the base /home/user/ have been updated to
             point to /home/user2/.  If you omit <I>new-base</I>, all matching
             torrents' <I>base</I> will be stripped from their location.  One
             important thing to note is that currently if you attempt to
             remove the base and the resulting relative path is still the same
             Transmission will _not_ update it to the relative path. However,
             once you do move the base, you can strip it to a relative path
             and not have to fuss if you move bases again.

     <B>-tm</B> <I>tracker-alias</I>
             Fuctionally equivalent to <B>-m</B> but filter out torrents not matching
             the trackers listed under <I>tracker-alias</I>

     <B>-dl</B>     Show information about downloading torrents.  This will include
             torrents that are both `uploading' and `downloading' information.

     <B>-tdl</B> <I>tracker-alias</I>
             Fuctionally equivalent to <B>-dl</B> but filter out torrents not
             matching the trackers listed under <I>tracker-alias</I>

     <B>-ns</B>     List number of torrents seeding.  This does NOT include torrents
             that are both `uploading' and `downloading' information.

     <B>-tns</B> <I>tracker-alias</I>
             Fuctionally equivalent to <B>-ns</B> but filter out torrents not
             matching the trackers listed under <I>tracker-alias</I>

     <B>-si</B>     Show information about seeding torrents.  This flag will display
             all information about each seeding torrent (equivalent to `-t id
             -i' in tr-remote).

     <B>-sul</B>    List seeding torrents and their upload rates.  This flag will
             display the `Name' and `Upload' lines in a tabular format.

     <B>-ta</B> [<I>tracker-alias</I>]
             Add a tracker alias to the <I>tracker</I> file interactively.  This
             option will ask the user to enter a tracker alias, the primary
             tracker to be associated with this alias, whether or not to add
             any secondary trackers and how many, then each secondary tracker
             on separate lines.

     <B>-tul</B> <I>tracker-alias</I>
             Functionally equivalent to the <B>-si</B> flag, but gets seeding
             torrents by tracker-alias.

     <B>-ts</B> <I>tracker-alias</I>
             List information about seeding torrents by tracker-alias. The

     <B>-td</B> <I>ID</I> <I>action</I>
             Add torrent to a queue that will perform <I>action</I> when it
             completes.  <I>action</I> is any valid option coupled with the tr-remote
             `-t' switch, however the leading dashes _must_ be removed.  This
             is the same format as the <B>-t</B> switch.  The variables
             ADD_TRACKER_DONE and ADD_TRACKER_DONE_ACT in <I>trop.conf</I> are used
             to control the behavior of this command.  See <I>README</I> for more
             information.

     <B>-notd</B>   Stop torrent from being added to the torrent-done queue if
             torrents are automatically being added with the ADD_TORRENT_DONE
             option in <I>trop.conf</I>.

     <B>-terr</B>   Show the name, ID, location and error field of torrents that show
             signs of an error.  <B>trop</B> will warn the user if it detects a
             torrent error.

     <B>-tdel</B> <I>tracker-alias</I>
             Remove <I>tracker-alias</I> from the <I>trackers</I> file.

     <B>-tl</B> [<I>tracker-alias</I>]
             Show all the tracker URLs that are binded to <I>tracker-alias</I>.  If
             no argument is supplied, <B>trop</B> will display all tracker-aliases
             and their tracker URLs.

     <B>-startup</B>
             Initialize <B>trop</B> defaults upon login. See <I>README</I> for more
             information.

     <B>-q</B>      Suppress all message output from <B>trop</B>.

     <B>-V</B> <B>-version</B>
             Show version information.  This includes the latest
             <B>transmission-remote(1)</B> version that <B>trop</B> was tested against.

     <B>-help</B>   Print a short description of the options on the command-line.
